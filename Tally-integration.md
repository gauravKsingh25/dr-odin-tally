To fetch Tally data from `http://192.168.0.163:9000` using XML payloads in your Node.js backend, you should:

1. Use a package like `axios` or `node-fetch` to make HTTP POST requests.
2. Send the required XML payload in the request body.
3. Parse the XML response (using a package like `xml2js`).

**Example integration (Node.js):**

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
const xml2js = require('xml2js');

async function fetchTallyData(xmlPayload) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://192.168.0.163:9000', xmlPayload, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/xml' }
    });
    // Parse XML response
    const result = await xml2js.parseStringPromise(response.data);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching Tally data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**How to use:**
- Prepare your XML payload as per Tally‚Äôs requirements.
- Call `fetchTallyData(xmlPayload)` in your controller/service.
- Use the parsed result for your frontend/API.
