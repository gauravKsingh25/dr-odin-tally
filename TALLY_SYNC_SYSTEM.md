# Tally Sync System Documentation

## Overview

The Tally Sync System is designed to automatically synchronize data between Tally ERP and the Dr. Odin application. The system runs a comprehensive **FULL SYNC** every day at **12:00 AM (midnight)** and excludes vouchers from the automatic sync as requested.

## System Architecture

### Key Components

1. **TallyCronJob** (`scripts/tally-cron.js`)
   - Main scheduler and sync orchestrator
   - Handles both full and partial sync operations
   - Manages cron scheduling and sync history

2. **TallyService** (`services/tallyService.js`)
   - Handles communication with Tally ERP
   - XML payload generation and parsing
   - Data normalization and transformation

3. **Tally Models** (`models/tally*.model.js`)
   - TallyCompany
   - TallyGroup
   - TallyCostCenter
   - TallyCurrency
   - TallyLedger
   - TallyStockItem
   - TallyVoucher

## Sync Schedule

### Full Sync (Automatic)
- **Schedule**: Daily at 12:00 AM (midnight)
- **Timezone**: Asia/Kolkata
- **Cron Pattern**: `0 0 * * *`

### What Gets Synced in Full Sync:
1. **Companies** - Complete company information
2. **Groups** - All ledger groups and hierarchies
3. **Cost Centers** - All cost center definitions
4. **Currencies** - Currency master data
5. **Ledgers** - All ledger accounts with full details
6. **Stock Items** - Complete stock item master data

### What's Excluded from Full Sync:
- **Vouchers** - Must be synced manually as requested

- Connection timeout handling
- Network failure recovery

### Data Validation
- XML parsing error handling
- Data type validation and conversion
- Duplicate prevention using GUID or name-based queries

## Sync Health Indicators

### Health Status Levels:
- **Excellent**: Full sync completed within last 24 hours
- **Good**: Partial sync completed within last 24 hours
- **Needs Attention**: Last sync was 1-7 days ago
- **Poor**: Last sync was more than 7 days ago
- **Unknown**: No sync data available

## Best Practices

### For Voucher Management
Since vouchers are excluded from automatic sync:
1. Use manual voucher sync endpoints when needed
2. Sync vouchers during low-activity periods
3. Consider date-range based voucher syncing for large datasets

### For Performance Optimization
1. Schedule intensive syncs during off-peak hours (12:00 AM is ideal)
2. Monitor sync duration and adjust if needed
3. Use partial sync for real-time data needs

### For Error Management
1. Monitor sync status regularly via dashboard
2. Check sync history for error patterns
3. Address connectivity issues promptly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tally Connection Failed**
   - Verify Tally is running and accessible
   - Check TALLY_URL configuration
   - Ensure port 9000 is not blocked

2. **Sync Taking Too Long**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Consider data volume and server resources
   - Review Tally ERP performance

3. **Incomplete Data Sync**
   - Check sync results for specific errors
   - Verify Tally data integrity
   - Review model schemas for compatibility

4. **Scheduler Not Running**
   - Check server logs for cron initialization
   - Verify timezone settings
   - Restart server if needed

### Support Commands

```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:7010/api/tally/health

# Get sync status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:7010/api/tally/sync/status

# Trigger manual full sync
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:7010/api/tally/sync/full

# View sync dashboard
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:7010/api/tally/dashboard/sync
```

## Security Considerations

- All sync endpoints require JWT token authentication
- Tally connection uses local network (secure by default)
- Sync history data is stored securely in database
- No sensitive data is exposed in logs

---

## Summary

The Tally Sync System provides:
- ‚úÖ **Automated daily full sync** at 12:00 AM
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive data synchronization** (excluding vouchers)
- ‚úÖ **Manual sync capabilities** for on-demand updates
- ‚úÖ **Detailed monitoring and dashboards**
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling and recovery**
- ‚úÖ **Flexible API endpoints** for integration

The system ensures your Dr. Odin application stays synchronized with Tally ERP data automatically while giving you full control over voucher synchronization as requested.
